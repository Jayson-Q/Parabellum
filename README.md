Si vis pacem, para bellum - If you want peace, prepare for war.

These files are intended as a precaution against 'accidental' injury or death. Within these files are screenshots, written and audio evidence of several acts which may be in contravention of criminal law in several countries (including the United States of America and the United Kingdom) as well as civil tortes.

In the event of injury or death, the decryption key will be automatically posted on several platforms. The decryption key is also held in an offline, secure locale to be opened in the event of injury with instructions on how and where to post.
